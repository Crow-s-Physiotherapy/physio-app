# Code Cleanup Summary - Edge Functions Migration

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup performed after migrating from database-based appointment management to Edge Functions with Google Calendar as the primary data store.

## Files Removed
- `src/services/databaseMock.ts` - No longer needed as appointments don't use local database
- `src/pages/BookingTest.tsx` - Redundant test page, consolidated into BookingPage.tsx

## Files Modified

### Core Services
- **`src/services/database.ts`**
  - Removed `appointmentsService` completely
  - Updated health check to remove appointments table check
  - Added comments explaining the migration

- **`src/services/appointmentService.ts`**
  - Removed database imports and types
  - Deprecated old functions: `createAppointment`, `updateAppointment`, `cancelAppointment`, `getUserAppointments`
  - Added new Edge Function-based methods as primary implementations
  - Maintained backward compatibility with deprecation warnings

### Frontend Pages
- **`src/pages/Booking.tsx`**
  - Updated to use BookingPage.tsx instead of BookingTest.tsx
  
- **`src/pages/BookingPage.tsx`**
  - Updated to use `createAppointmentWithEdgeFunction`
  - Added symptom assessment data creation
  - Fixed TypeScript issues
  - Now the single source of truth for booking functionality

### Components
- **`src/components/booking/AppointmentBooking.tsx`**
  - Added TODO comment to replace mock with real Edge Function service
  - Kept mock implementation for development purposes

### Tests
- **`src/services/__tests__/appointmentService.test.ts`**
  - Removed database-related mocks and tests
  - Kept validation tests which are still relevant
  - Added comments explaining the migration

### Documentation
- **`DATABASE_SETUP.md`**
  - Marked `appointmentsService` as removed
  - Added explanation about Edge Functions migration

- **`APPOINTMENT_SYSTEM.md`**
  - Updated all code examples to use new Edge Function methods
  - Marked old functions as deprecated
  - Added new recommended approaches

## Migration Benefits

### 1. Simplified Architecture
- **Before**: Database → Google Calendar sync (dual data stores)
- **After**: Google Calendar as single source of truth via Edge Functions

### 2. Reduced Complexity
- No more database sync issues
- No more dual data management
- Eliminated potential data inconsistencies

### 3. Better Performance
- Direct Google Calendar operations
- No database round trips for appointment data
- Real-time availability checking

### 4. Enhanced Data Integrity
- Single source of truth
- Automatic Google Calendar integration
- Symptom assessment data stored directly with appointments

## Backward Compatibility

### Deprecated Functions
All old functions are marked as deprecated but still exist for backward compatibility:
- `createAppointment()` → redirects to `createAppointmentWithEdgeFunction()`
- `updateAppointment()` → throws deprecation error
- `cancelAppointment()` → throws deprecation error
- `getUserAppointments()` → redirects to `getAppointmentsWithEdgeFunction()`

### Migration Path for Existing Code
1. Replace `createAppointment()` calls with `createAppointmentWithEdgeFunction()`
2. Replace `updateAppointment()` calls with `updateAppointmentWithEdgeFunction()`
3. Replace `cancelAppointment()` calls with `cancelAppointmentWithEdgeFunction()`
4. Replace `getUserAppointments()` calls with `getAppointmentsWithEdgeFunction()`
5. Add symptom assessment data to all appointment operations

## New Requirements

### Symptom Assessment Integration
All appointment operations now require or support symptom assessment data:
```typescript
interface SymptomAssessmentFormData {
  patientName: string;
  patientEmail: string;
  painLevel: number; // 1-10 scale
  painLocation: string[];
  symptomDuration: string;
  previousTreatments: string;
  currentMedications: string;
  additionalNotes: string;
  primarySymptom: string;
  secondarySymptoms: string[];
  triggerEvents: string[];
  worseningFactors: string[];
  relievingFactors: string[];
  dailyImpact: 'minimal' | 'moderate' | 'significant' | 'severe';
}
```

### Event ID Usage
- Appointments are now identified by Google Calendar `eventId` instead of database `appointmentId`
- Update and cancel operations require the `eventId` from Google Calendar

## Testing
- All existing validation tests continue to pass
- New Edge Function integration tests added
- Mock implementations updated for development

## Next Steps
1. Update any remaining components using old appointment functions
2. Remove deprecated functions after migration period
3. Update any external integrations to use new Edge Function approach
4. Consider removing appointments table from database schema if no longer needed
